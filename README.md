# How to Volt - From 0 to 60

## Introduction
Hi. You're a developer, or someone interested in writing some code. A web app even! This is fun. Awesome.
We're going to learn about Volt today. Volt is a web framework that allows us to write applications in which
the client and server are perfectly synced at all times. Reactivity! Woo! It is also powered by Opal [add link]
so that all of our code can be in Ruby, client and server both!

## Why Volt?
I love Meteor.js. I also am not the biggest fan of JavaScript as a whole. Thus, Volt seemed to be a great avenue
to have these capabilities without having to deal with `undefined is not a function`.

## Getting Started
I will treat this tutorial as a system for someone with 0 configuration coming in. So we will cover 'basic' things
such as managing Ruby versions with rbenv, setting up and using bundler, and generally configuring an environment
for Ruby development.

## More soon.....
